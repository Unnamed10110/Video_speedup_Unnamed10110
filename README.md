## How It Works

The extension works by:

1. **Detecting videos** using platform-specific CSS selectors
2. **Listening for mouse events** on video elements (mousedown, mouseup, mouseleave)
3. **Modifying playback rate** using the HTML5 video API
4. **Providing visual feedback** through on-screen indicators
5. **Managing state** across page navigation and new videos
6. **Platform adaptation** with specific logic for each supported platform

### Technical Implementation

- **Event handling**: Uses `mousedown`, `mouseup`, and `mouseleave` for precise hold detection
- **Speed persistence**: Multiple delayed speed applications for YouTube compatibility
- **State management**: Tracks original speeds, current speeds, and active states
- **DOM observation**: MutationObserver for detecting new videos in SPAs
- **Memory management**: WeakSet for tracking processed videos, cleanup intervals
- **Lazy loading**: Debounced video detection for optimal performance
- **Floating panel**: Draggable interface with real-time speed control
- **Speed lock**: Persistent speed application across video changes

## Technical Details

- **Manifest Version**: 3 (latest Chrome extension standard)
- **Permissions**: 
  - `activeTab`: Access to current tab
  - `scripting`: Execute scripts in tabs
- **Host Permissions**: 
  - `https://www.tiktok.com/*`
  - `https://www.youtube.com/*`
  - `https://vimeo.com/*`
  - `https://www.twitch.tv/*`
  - `https://www.instagram.com/*`
- **Content Script**: Injected into all supported platform pages
- **Popup**: Provides user interface and controls

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not working?

1. **Check if you're on a supported platform**
   - The extension works on `tiktok.com`, `youtube.com`, `vimeo.com`, `twitch.tv`, and `instagram.com`
   - Make sure you're on the correct domain

2. **Verify installation**
   - Go to `brave://extensions/`
   - Ensure "Video Speedup" is enabled
   - Check for any error messages

3. **Refresh the page**
   - Sometimes the extension needs a page refresh to activate
   - Try refreshing the page after installing

4. **Check console for errors**
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Look for any error messages in the Console tab

### Videos not speeding up?

1. **Click location**
   - Make sure you're clicking on the **right side** for speed-up
   - Make sure you're clicking on the **left side** for slow-down
   - The clickable areas are the outer 30% of the video

2. **Hold duration**
   - You must **hold** the left click, not just click
   - The speed indicator should appear while holding

3. **Video detection**
   - The extension may need time to detect new videos
   - Try scrolling to a different video and back

4. **Platform-specific issues**
   - **YouTube**: The extension aggressively overrides native speed controls
   - **TikTok**: Works with direct video element manipulation
   - **Other platforms**: Uses standard HTML5 video API

### Keyboard shortcuts not working?

1. **Input field focus**
   - Shortcuts are disabled when typing in input fields
   - Make sure you're not in a text input or textarea

2. **Browser shortcuts**
   - Some browsers may intercept `+` and `-` keys
   - Try using the popup buttons instead

### Floating panel not appearing?

1. **Enable floating panel**
   - Toggle the "Floating Panel" switch in the popup
   - Or press `F` key to toggle

2. **Panel positioning**
   - The panel is draggable - click and drag to reposition
   - Make sure it's not hidden behind other elements

## Development

### Making Changes

1. **Edit files** as needed
2. **Reload extension** in `brave://extensions/`
3. **Refresh the page** to see changes

### Adding Features

- **New speeds**: Modify the `speedSequence` array in `content.js`
- **UI changes**: Edit `popup.html` and `popup.js`
- **Functionality**: Modify `content.js` for core features
- **Platform support**: Add new host permissions and detection logic

## Privacy & Security

- **No data collection**: The extension doesn't collect or transmit any data
- **Local only**: All functionality runs locally in your browser
- **Minimal permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions for supported platforms
- **Open source**: Code is transparent and auditable
